A brilliant rosÃ© wine from Ä°zmir, Turkey. What truly 
 <br>caught my eye with this wine was not just the
 <br>taste, but the unique grapes in which this winery
 <br>uses. The Ã‡alkarasi grape is a lesser known grape  <br>variety, that is only grown in Turkey due to it's  <br>ability to grow in course terrains. Not only is  <br>this grape an odd ball grape, but it is generally
 <br> not used in rosÃ©, and is found in cheap table wine.
 <br> This wine is truly destined to knock your socks off.
 <br>You'll experience the true fresh beauty of the 
 <br>Ã‡alkarasi, and the stainless steel fermentation <br> provides a crisp finish on the back end</b>

Austria always makes amazing fresh and young
 <br> wines, and I always look for these when I'm at the 
 <br> store. What suprised me was how fizzy this rosÃ© was
 <br> , and it is quite fizzy. At the backend of this wine
 <br>, you will be entertained with a great amount of 
 <br>acitity, which lingers with you for a while. Another 
 <br> major positive with this wine is the alcohol percentage. 
 <br> Sitting at only 10.5% alcohol, this is not a heavy wine
 <br>that can be enjoyed by all.

The appellation of the Finger Lakes is perfect
<br>for riesling grapes, which is why I always keep a 
<br>look out for wines like this. With this wine you
<br> will enjoy a nice body, with a nice medium dry 
<br> finish. This medium dry finish is the key to why
<br> this wine is so successful, as it will pair very
<br> well with our meal. My first thought when drinking
<br> this wine was pairing it with some Middle Eastern
<br> food, since this wine would perfectly compliment 
<br>the spice. A hint of oak on the backend elevates
<br> the beautiful finish. Lastly, the coloring is 
<br> marvelous for such an inexpensive wine, and 
<br>branches out glorious legs upon swirling.

A very nice wine from the Catalan region of 
<br>Spain. This is a very versatile wine, which can
<br> readily pair with a peasant meal or a fancy meal.
<br> Overall extremely dry, and has a nice acidic
<br> finish that lingers. The wine is also extremely
<br> well balanced, and is only 12% alcohol, which is 
<br> perfect for a white of this caliber. It also has
<br> interesting combination of grapes, as it uses the
<br> Macabeo, Chardonnay, and PenedÃ¨s grapes.
