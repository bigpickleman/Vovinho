A brilliant rosÃ© wine from Ä°zmir, Turkey. What truly 
 <br>caught my eye with this wine was not just the
 <br>taste, but the unique grapes in which this winery
 <br>uses. The Ã‡alkarasi grape is a lesser known grape  <br>variety, that is only grown in Turkey due to it's  <br>ability to grow in course terrains. Not only is  <br>this grape an odd ball grape, but it is generally
 <br> not used in rosÃ©, and is found in cheap table wine.
 <br> This wine is truly destined to knock your socks off.
 <br>You'll experience the true fresh beauty of the 
 <br>Ã‡alkarasi, and the stainless steel fermentation <br> provides a crisp finish on the back end</b>

Austria always makes amazing fresh and young
 <br> wines, and I always look for these when I'm at the 
 <br> store. What suprised me was how fizzy this rosÃ© was
 <br> , and it is quite fizzy. At the backend of this wine
 <br>, you will be entertained with a great amount of 
 <br>acitity, which lingers with you for a while. Another 
 <br> major positive with this wine is the alcohol percentage. 
 <br> Sitting at only 10.5% alcohol, this is not a heavy wine
 <br>that can be enjoyed by all.

The appellation of the Finger Lakes is perfect
<br>for riesling grapes, which is why I always keep a 
<br>look out for wines like this. With this wine you
<br> will enjoy a nice body, with a nice medium dry 
<br> finish. This medium dry finish is the key to why
<br> this wine is so successful, as it will pair very
<br> well with our meal. My first thought when drinking
<br> this wine was pairing it with some Middle Eastern
<br> food, since this wine would perfectly compliment 
<br>the spice. A hint of oak on the backend elevates
<br> the beautiful finish. Lastly, the coloring is 
<br> marvelous for such an inexpensive wine, and 
<br>branches out glorious legs upon swirling.

A very nice wine from the Catalan region of 
<br>Spain. This is a very versatile wine, which can
<br> readily pair with a peasant meal or a fancy meal.
<br> Overall extremely dry, and has a nice acidic
<br> finish that lingers. The wine is also extremely
<br> well balanced, and is only 12% alcohol, which is 
<br> perfect for a white of this caliber. It also has
<br> interesting combination of grapes, as it uses the
<br> Macabeo, Chardonnay, and PenedÃ¨s grapes.

This is a beautiful light sparkling wine from
<br> Spain. This wine uses the standard Macabeo grapes
<br> that are used in many Catalunyan wines. However, 
<br>I was absolutley blown away by the quality of this 
<br> wine considering the price. A beautiful flowery 
<br> finish is complimented by a good amount of acidity.
<br> This wine also is very versatile in it's pairing, 
<br>as I have enjoyed it with a wide array of seafood
<br> meals, and it has gone splendidly with all. I also 
<br> would love to highlight the wonderful environmental
<br> initiatives that this winery does. When purchasing,
<br> a portion of your sale will go to protecting the
<br> Earth's oceans, which is more important now 
<br>than ever.

One of my biggest pet peeves with wines is 
<br> if they overoak their wines. Over oaking a wine
<br> completely spoils the wine, and shows how poor
<br> a winery is. Rarely ever is a wine truly over-
<br>oaked, as many cheap wines have artificial oak 
<br> added to them. Luckily, there is a solution to 
<br> this, and that is to buy an unoaked wine! I
<br> would suggest letting this bottle sit for 2-10
<br> years, as we enjoyed a ten year old bottle and 
<br>it was truly perfect. A nice smooth wine with a
<br> solid finish. Pairs with almost any fish meal
<br> that you can imagine.

This is one of the greatest bang for your bucks
<br> that you'll ever find. This wine is simple, but 
<br> beautiful. It is fantastic all around, with minor
<br> flaws, and hints of tropical citrus all through-
<br>out. This wine is produced from the Santa Barbara
<br> Valley in California. Although California is not
<br> highly regarded as one of the leading Sauvignon 
<br>Blanc producers, it has been picking in recent
<br> years. Do not let this wines appearance, location,
<br>the spice. A hint of oak on the backend elevates
<br> or price fool you. This wine is worth your time.

Out of all the wines on this list, I have
<br> the least to say about this one. I had to add a
<br> brut on this list, and this one is just good.
<br> Overall it goes extremely well with most meals
<br> and has a pretty good nose and finish that grabs
<br> hold of you from your first sip. Not too fizzy &
<br> not too sweet.

This is a very good txakoli wine, and is one of
<br> the only ones widely found in the United States. 
<br> I really encourage everyone to take a dive into
<br> the wines of the Basque region of Spain, and 
<br>test out some txakolis. This is the perfect one
<br> to test out, as it is pleasant and cheap. This
<br> wine is very nicely balanced, is not too dry
<br> and has a brilliant finish.

When you are looking at the Sauvignon Blanc
<br> section at your local wine shop, make sure to
<br> monitor the New Zealand ones from Marlborough.
<br> Always make sure to purchase the new ones that
<br> you see, and compare them. Marlborough makes
<br> the best Sauvignon Blancs in New Zealand, and
<br> you can never go wrong with one of these. 
<br> However, this Greywacke is absolutley stellar.
<br> It is not only one of my highest rated wines
<br> under $20, but overall as well. It is a 
<br>glorious full bodied wine, with just the perfect 
<br>punch of acidity on the back end.
